# Description

One month into our training at BeCode.org, we were assigned a random website. The purpose was to improve that website.  Our time frame for this exercise was 1 day: we received the intructions in the morning and had to deliver by 5pm that same day.  Below, you'll find the project instructions we received from our BeCode coach.  Original website that I had to "immprove": [fredfinestmarket.be](http://fredfinestmarket.be/). My new version of this website: [](https://sonia012.github.io/filrouge-0-guerrilla/)


### Your Mission
Your coach assigns you to a project.
Create and deploy before 5PM a one-pager that looks and communicate better than their current site, and is responsive.
The only possible way is to use a framework like bootstrap or tweak a template (pick one here : [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/)).

### The specifics
- Hosting via a GitHub Page
- Use the content on their existing website to create a better one. If they don't have one, gather content based on what you can find       on the web. Mac Gyver style. You don't have to use all of their content, summarize it by focusing on what's really important to         understand who they are, and what they do.
- Pick a framework or template on [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/)
- Tweak the template to adapt it to the content
- Once published, you are not done. Use the Lighthouse Test and improve the score as much as you can for each category.
